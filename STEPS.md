1. Initialize Component State and Structure:

    - [ ] For each component file you have created, start by defining the component structure and any state variables you might need using React Hooks (if using functional components) or class state (if using class components).

2. Implement Basic Navigation:

    - [ ] Set up react-router-dom in your App.js to handle routing between the different components.
    - [ ] Implement a basic navigation bar in the Header.js component to allow switching between the Login, Register, and Dashboard components.

3. Develop Individual Components:

    - [ ] Flesh out the Login.js and Register.js components with form elements and validation logic.
    - [ ] For StudentDashboard.js, TeacherDashboard.js, and AdminDashboard.js, start by creating the layout and displaying static data as placeholders.

4. Integrate Context API for State Management:

    - [ ] Use AuthContext.js to manage authentication state across the application.
    - [ ] Provide functions for logging in, registering, and logging out users, and maintain the user's authentication status.

5. Style Components:

    - [ ] Apply CSS for each component. You can use App.css for global styles and component-specific CSS files for scoped styling.
    - [ ] Ensure your application is responsive and follows the design mock-ups provided.

6. Connect to the Backend:

    - [ ] Implement API calls to the backend using fetch or libraries like axios to retrieve and send data to your server.
    - [ ] Ensure that the Dashboard components can display dynamic data fetched from the backend.

7. Testing:

    - [ ] Write tests for your components using App.test.js or individual test files for each component to ensure that your application behaves as expected.

8. Refinement and Review:

    - [ ] Review your application's functionality and user experience.
    - [ ] Refine any components that require additional work or that you would like to improve.

9. Deployment Preparation:

    - [ ] Before deploying, ensure that all environment variables and build scripts are properly set up.
    - [ ] Test the production build of your application locally to ensure that everything is working as expected.
